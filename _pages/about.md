Hi, I’m a Master's student in Mathematics under the supervision of <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/math/knuepfer/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. H. Knüpfer</a> at Heidelberg University, and associated with the the <a href="https://structures.uni-heidelberg.de/YRC.php" target=" blank">Young Researchers Convent</a>, a subgroup of <a href="https://www.structures.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php" target=" blank">STRUCTURES.

I recently finished my PhD in Mathematical Physics on connections between topologically twisted supersymmetric field theories, Floer theories, and knot homologies under the supervision of Johannes Walcher.

Currently, I’m switching gears and my new project revolves around geometric neighbour embeddings, with the ultimate goal of extracting dynamical information from single cell RNA velocity data during cell differentiation. This research is part of the Applied Analysis and Modelling in Biosciences group of Anna Marciniak-Czochra and developed in collarboration with Anna Wienhard at the MPI MiS.

In general, I’m fascinated by the unreasonable effectiveness of abstract mathematics in the natural sciences and vice versa. I’m always happy to chat about new examples!
